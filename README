Crack
=====

You're about to use Crack. Be careful, it can be addicting. While no, it's not
the drug, it's close: a roguelike. A simple one that includes the basic features
of games like Nethack, but in a smaller and actively-developed package.

About Crack
-----------

Crack's a deceptively complicated roguelike. When I designed it, it was late at
night and I was frustrated because there were no Nethack builds for Intel-based
OS X computers (and I was way too lazy to build it). So, I scribbled down some
basic goals:

 - random items that require ID
 - IDing by use is dangerous
 - 1-5 floors? Not many
 - Despite size, inc char progression
 - Few (but >3) classes & races -- use Crawl's method?

In other words, I wanted a coffeebreak-length game (30, maybe 60 minutes) that
felt like Nethack, in that it was a game that hated the player if you wanted to
beat it, you should expect to do some thinking and work.

If you had hoped to learn how to play, read `doc/handbook.md` for the Crackbook.


Foil library
------------

Curses doesn't come on OS X, and more specifically, neither does a Ruby binding
for it (I don't even know what to look for: rbcurses, ruby-curses, ncurses). So
I just did the same thing that I did with my HTML 7DRL: wrote a simple little
console text library using escapes. It's probably not efficient, or fast, but it
works. If you want to use Foil in your own project, grab it from `lib/foil.rb`
and be sure to read the documentation at `doc/foil.md`
